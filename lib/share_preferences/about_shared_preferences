//Shared preferences:
    •	SharedPreferences is a key-value store that allows you to save and retrieve data.
    •	It is used to store small amounts of data that you want to persist across app launches.
    •	SharedPreferences is a simple way to save primitive data types like booleans, floats, ints, longs, and strings.
    •	SharedPreferences is a singleton class that you can use to save and retrieve data.
    •	SharedPreferences is a lightweight way to store data, but it is not suitable for storing large amounts of data.
    •	SharedPreferences is not secure, and it should not be used to store sensitive data like passwords or API keys.

Key Concepts:
	•	Saving Data: SharedPreferences saves data as key-value pairs. You can save basic data types like strings, ints, double, bool, and List<String>.
	•	Retrieving Data: You can retrieve the saved data using the key. It returns null if the key does not exist.
	•	Removing Data: You can remove a single key-value pair or clear all saved data.
