//Flutter secure storge:
    •	Flutter Secure Storage is a secure way to store sensitive data that you want to persist across app launches.
	•	Security: flutter_secure_storage encrypts data, making it safer than regular storage options like SharedPreferences.
	•	Limitations: Avoid using it for large data. It’s suitable for credentials, tokens, or small, sensitive data.
	•	Platform-specific Setup:
        •	Android: Works out of the box. Ensure the app has no issues with minSdkVersion (at least 18).
        •	iOS: Works seamlessly with the Keychain.
